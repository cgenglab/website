bio: 
  I'm a master student of the Department of Creative Informatics at the University of Tokyo, supervised by Prof. Nobuyuki Umetani. I obtained my bachelor degree in Computer Science and Technology from Peking University. My research interest is Computer Graphics, especially realistic and real-time simulation. <br>
  Besides, I'm also excited in superhero movies, astrophotography, as well as discoveries of relationship between different languages. If you have similar interests, I'm very glad to have a coffee time with you :)
